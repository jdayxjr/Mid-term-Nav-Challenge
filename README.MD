# Mid-term Nav challenge

Names: Jay Dawson II

Your team must make a totally responsive site that has navigation that changes to mobile navigation. It must have at least 4 links and change content. You must use the MVC model. Also, you don't have to have a ton of content on each page. Just load some on there.
